# ABC Call Volume Trend Analysis

### Final Project-4

__Difficulty Level:__ Advanced

## Project Overview:

In this project, we focus on analyzing call volume trends for the __inbound customer service team__ of ABC Insurance Company. The goal is to provide strategic insights into call patterns, average call durations, manpower planning, and resource allocation to optimize customer experience. We explore key metrics to reduce abandoned calls and propose solutions for effective manpower distribution across different time buckets.

ABC Insurance Company operates in a highly competitive market, where customer experience plays a crucial role in maintaining a positive brand image. Inbound customer support is central to this effort, as it handles inquiries and issues from existing and prospective customers. Our analysis leverages real call data to uncover trends and opportunities for improving service delivery.

## Business Context:

__Customer experience (CX) analytics__ has become critical for businesses to understand and enhance customer interactions. The CX team's responsibility extends beyond handling calls to analyzing data and drawing insights for process improvements. With AI tools like __Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Robotic Process Automation (RPA), and Predictive Analytics__, businesses are continuously optimizing their customer support strategies.

In the case of inbound support, handling call volume efficiently is key. This project uses ABC's call data to understand:

1. __Average Call Duration –__ Measure the average time spent by agents on calls across different time buckets.

2. __Call Volume Analysis –__ Visualize and analyze the number of calls received over time.

3. __Manpower Planning –__ Optimize staffing to reduce the abandoned call rate and improve service during the day and night shifts.

## Key Analytical Tasks:

### 1. Average Call Duration:

- __Objective:__ Calculate the average duration of calls for each time bucket (e.g., 9-10 AM, 10-11 AM, etc.).

### 2. Call Volume Analysis:

- __Objective:__ Visualize the total number of calls received in different time buckets and observe patterns in call volume.

### 3. Manpower Planning for Day Shift (9 AM - 9 PM):

- __Objective:__ Propose a manpower plan to reduce the call abandon rate from 30% to 10%.

### 4. Manpower Planning for Night Shift (9 PM - 9 AM):

- __Objective:__ Develop a plan for night shift staffing to ensure that night-time callers receive support and maintain a low abandon rate.

## Assumptions and Constraints:

1. Each agent works __6 days a week__ with an average of __4 unplanned leaves per month__.
2. Agents work __9 hours per day__, with __1.5 hours__ dedicated to breaks.
3. Agents spend 60% of their working hours (__7.5 hours/day__) on customer calls.
4. A month is assumed to have __30 days__ for the purpose of calculating manpower.

## Methodology:

1. __Data Processing:__ Cleaned and structured the dataset for analysis. This includes details like agent IDs, queue time, call duration, and call status (abandoned, answered, transferred).

2. __Visualization:__ Call volume trends are visualized using graphs and charts to showcase the distribution of calls across time buckets.
3. __Manpower Calculation:__ Staffing requirements are calculated based on the call abandon rate and the desired service level, ensuring that the team is optimally staffed throughout the day.

## Insights

- The average call duration is __199 seconds__ or __3 mins and 19 seconds__.
- The __peak call__ activity is observed during __midday__.
- __High rates of abandoned calls__ during peak periods from __9 AM to 12 PM__ and from __8 PM to 9 PM__, with __lower abandonment rates__ observed in the __afternoon__, highlight fluctuations in call abandonment  throughout the day.
