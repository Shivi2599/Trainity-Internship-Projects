## Description

Imagine you're a data analyst working alongside the __Product Team__ at Instagram. Your primary responsibility is to analyze user interactions and engagement to provide actionable insights that can drive business growth.

- __Marketing:__ Tailor campaigns and reward loyal users.
- __Product:__ Decide which features to build based on user behavior.
- __Development:__ Improve the user experience by analyzing activity and engagement trends.
  
This project focuses on answering key business questions using __SQL__ and __MySQL Workbench__. Your SQL expertise will uncover insights that can shape the future direction of one of the world's most influential social media platforms.

## Project Tasks:

### A) Marketing Analysis

1. #### Loyal User Reward:

- __Goal:__ The marketing team wants to reward the most loyal usersâ€”those who have been with the platform for the longest time.
- __Task:__ Identify the five oldest users on Instagram by registration date.
 ##### SQL Query:
 ``` sql
SELECT username, created_at
FROM users
ORDER BY username, created_at ASC
LIMIT 5;
```

2. #### Inactive User Engagement:

- __Goal:__ Encourage inactive users to start posting by sending them promotional emails.
- __Task:__ Identify users who have never posted a photo.
 ##### SQL Query:
 ``` sql
SELECT username
FROM users
LEFT JOIN photos ON users.id = photos.user_id
WHERE photos.user_id IS NULL;
```

3. #### Contest Winner Declaration:

- __Goal:__ Determine the winner of a contest where the user with the most likes on a single photo wins.
- __Task:__ Identify the user with the highest number of likes on a single post.
 ##### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT username, photos.id, photos.image_url,
COUNT(likes.user_id) as like_count
FROM photos
INNER JOIN likes ON likes.photo_id=photos.id
INNER JOIN users ON users.id=photos.user_id
GROUP BY photo_id
ORDER BY like_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

4. #### Hashtag Research:
   
- __Goal:__ A partner brand wants to know which hashtags are most effective for engagement.
- __Task:__ Identify the top five most commonly used hashtags on the platform.
 ##### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT tag_name ,count(*) as hashtag_count
FROM tags
JOIN photo_tags ON photo_tags.tag_id= tags.id
GROUP BY tag_name
ORDER BY hashtag_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

5. #### Ad Campaign Launch:

- __Goal:__ Find the best day of the week to launch a new ad campaign based on user registration activity.
- __Task:__ Identify the day of the week with the highest number of user registrations.
 ##### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT DAYNAME(created_at) AS registration_day,
COUNT(*) AS registration_count
FROM users
GROUP BY registration_day
ORDER BY registration_count DESC
limit 2;
```

### B) Investor Metrics

1. #### User Engagement:

- __Goal:__ Provide insights into how engaged users are and how frequently they post.
- __Task:__ Calculate the average number of posts per user and provide the total number of posts divided by the total number of users.
 ##### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT AVG(photo_count) AS average_posts_per_user
FROM (
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS photo_count
FROM photos
GROUP BY user_id
)user_photos_count;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_photos, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS
total_users,
COUNT(*) / COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS
average_photos_per_user
FROM photos;
```

2. #### Bots & Fake Accounts:

- __Goal:__ Identify users who may be bots or fake accounts by detecting unusual behavior.
- __Task:__ Identify users who have liked every single photo on Instagram.
 ##### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT id, username
FROM users
JOIN (
SELECT user_id
FROM likes
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT likes.photo_id) = (SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT image_url) FROM photos)
) likes ON users.id = likes.user_id
ORDER BY username ASC;
```

## Tools Used:

- SQL
